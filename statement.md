📌 Problem Statement

Managing supermarket billing, inventory, and customer orders manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Supermarkets and grocery stores need a simple system that can:

Display available products with real-time stock

Allow customers to select items and purchase them

Handle cart operations (add/remove)

Automatically update inventory

Calculate total bills accurately

Apply discounts or coupons

Generate a proper receipt

Record customer details and order information


Without such a system, mistakes can occur in stock management, billing calculations, and customer order processing. A simple, user-friendly digital solution is needed to automate these tasks.
