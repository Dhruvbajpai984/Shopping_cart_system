📌 Problem Statement

Managing supermarket billing, inventory, and customer orders manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Supermarkets and grocery stores need a simple system that can:

Display available products with real-time stock

Allow customers to select items and purchase them

Handle cart operations (add/remove)

Automatically update inventory

Calculate total bills accurately

Apply discounts or coupons

Generate a proper receipt

Record customer details and order information


Without such a system, mistakes can occur in stock management, billing calculations, and customer order processing. A simple, user-friendly digital solution is needed to automate these tasks.

Users can remove items or adjust quantities.

The system tracks:

Item names

Quantities

Total cost


Prevents adding more items than available in stock.


3. Billing and Checkout

Displays a complete bill with:

Item names

Quantity purchased

Unit price

Subtotal


Calculates grand total automatically.

Supports coupon code application (e.g., SAVE10).


4. Receipt Generation

Saves a detailed receipt as a text file.

Receipt includes:

Customer name

Order ID

Items and totals

Delivery address

Expected delivery date


5. User Interaction Through Menu

Users can:

1. View items


2. Add to cart


3. Remove from cart


4. Checkout


5. Exit



Inputs are handled using a simple console interface.


6. Order and Delivery Simulation

Random Order ID generator.

Random estimated delivery date.

Enhances realism of the shopping experience.


7. Basic Error Handling
